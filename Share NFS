Bash
sudo yum install nfs-utils rpcbind
Use code with caution.

Configure NFS on the sharing machine:
Export the shared folder:
sudo nano /etc/exports
Add a line like this:
/path/to/shared/folder <client_ip>(rw,sync)
Replace <client_ip> with the IP address of the client machine.
Restart NFS:
Bash
sudo systemctl restart nfs-server
Use code with caution.

Configure NFS on the client machine:
showmount -e ip shard server for list all shared 
Mount the shared folder:
Bash
sudo mount -t nfs <server_ip>:/path/to/shared/folder /mount_point
Use code with caution.

Replace <server_ip> with the IP address of the sharing machine, and mount_point with the desired mount point on the client machine.
3. Using SSHFS:

Install SSHFS on both machines:
Bash
sudo yum install sshfs
Use code with caution.

Create a public-private key pair on the sharing machine:
Bash
ssh-keygen -t rsa
Use code with caution.

Copy the public key to the authorized_keys file on the client machine:
Bash
scp ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub user@client_ip:~/.ssh/authorized_keys
Use code with caution.

Mount the shared folder on the client machine:
Bash
sudo mount -t sshfs user@server_ip:/path/to/shared/folder /mount_point
Use code with caution.

Replace user with the username on the sharing machine, server_ip with the IP address of the sharing machine, and mount_point with the desired mount point on the client machine.
